libraries in the [Samvera](https://github.com/samvera) Github organization.

## Templates

[README.md](./templates/README.md) - The elements in this template should be in
every repository. Additional elements may be added.

[SUPPORT.md](./templates/SUPPORT.md) - Copy this and replace `{{library}}` with
the repository name. This is linked from the README and has information on how
to create an issue, email the list, and connect to Slack.
